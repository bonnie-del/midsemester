<h2>Why advocate a business entity to invest in having a company website</h2>

<H3>Wider audience reach due to website accessibility 24/7</H3>
<P>Regardless of what kind of small business you are running, having a website accessible on a 7-day 24-hour basis without taking breaks for holidays and weekends is a huge advantage. While your physical shop is closed at night, your online shop can keep on selling and bringing you income by catering to customers at any time that is convenient for them<BR><BR>One more reason to create a web presence for your business is a reduction of distances. A website allows you to expand your target audience and make deals with customers who are located far away from you</P>

    <H3>Customer insights by tracking user behaviour on your website</H3>
    <P>Matching and exceeding the expectations of your audience allows you to reach customer satisfaction and earn customer loyalty.<BR> If you want to offer your clients exactly what they need, obviously you should know what they really need and who they actually are.<BR>When you have a website, itâ€™s easy to monitor how users interact with it. <br>You can find out what your product or service people like the most and what they like the least, from what geographic location, devices and third-party sites they usually come, and much more.</P>
<H3> Having a website is an opportunity to make a great first impression and give people comfort that you're a real business</H3>

<H3>Brand</H3>
<P>Showcasing your brand to your prospective customers is one of the most important things that you can do. <br>By clearly establishing who you are, what you represent and what you stand for, you increase the chances of your customers buying from you.<br>

    This is also something that can set you apart from your competitors. Without a website, it can be incredibly challenging to do this because people can't easily find quality and reliable information on your business.</P>
